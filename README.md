# Analysis of Google Play Store apps
Data science project using data cleaning and visualization to generate insights about user's sentiments

This project was developed to understand better how apps' popularity differs from "Free" to "Paid", as also how users' feelings reflect on their evaluation on Google Play Store.

Here's a sample of pricing over the most popular categories available on store.

I recommend using Jupyter or Google Colab for visualization of this notebook. There are two versions of the notebook, English and Brazilian Portuguese. Suit yourselves!
